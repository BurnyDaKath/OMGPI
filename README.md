# OMGPI
Open Minecraft Game Programming Interface - Create a Spigot/CraftBukkit minigame server in seconds

OMGPI is an open-source spigot plugin based on FGAPI (FishGameAPI) from ClijCraft Network server. It manages special game plugins (or modules) and each game matches, teams, kits and many more. The Modules are really easy to create and manage, you can create fully-functional game in maximum of half a hour (for game-special features, half an hour is estimate for developing games like Skywars), and OMGPI handles the rest.

OMGPI contains 5 parts: Module, Basefig, Modfig, Mapfig, Loots/Kits basic files.
Module (GameName.jar) is your custom game - you manage the gameplay and events there.
Basefig (base.omgc) is the base configuration for the plugin.
Modfig (mod.omgc) is module configuration for your plugin.
Mapfig (map.omgc) is map (+team) configuration.
Loots/Kits files (.kit and .loot) in corresponding folders manage kits and loots default for all maps.

The plugin is in earliest stage of development. All bug reports and suggestions should be issued to dev branch, so I could decide that the bug is present in latest dev and master releases. If you notice some bug in master branch release, make sure the bug is major, else report to dev branch.
