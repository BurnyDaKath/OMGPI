For more info look on [our website](http://omgpi.tk/)!

OMGPI is an open-source spigot plugin by Kirill Semyonkin aka BurnyDaKath based on FishGameAPI from ClijCraft Network. 
It manages special game plugins and matches, teams, kits and many more. 
Games are really easy to create and manage, you can create fully-functional game in under half a hour (for game-special features, half an hour is estimate for developing games like Skywars), and OMGPI handles the rest.

OMGPI must be run on BungeeCord network under own server, since it manages all players and plugins on the server.
Also each OMGPI version can be only run under its spigot version, but you can update yourself by recompiling under newer NMS core.

OMGPI contains 5 parts: Game, Mainfig, Gamefig, Mapfig, Loots/Kits basic files.
*   GameName.jar is your custom game - you manage the gameplay and events there.
*   Mainfig (main.omgc) is the main configuration for the plugin.
*   Gamefig (game.omgc) is game configuration for your plugin.
*   Mapfig (map.omgc) is map (+team) configuration.
*   Loots/Kits files (.kit and .loot) in corresponding folders manage kits and loots default for all maps.

The plugin is in earliest stage of development (Alpha).
